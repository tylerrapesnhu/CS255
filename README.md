# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
# The client, DriverPass, is a company that trains students for their DMV testing. They wanted me to design a program that would house their customers payments, driving records, profile, and so on. 

# What did you do particularly well?
#I believe both the document template and the graphs created were done partiuclarly well. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
# I believe that I could have gone into more detail on the UML Class Diagram. While it wasn't required, per instructions, I believe this could have had a great detail more of information. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
# I tried to not only see what the client was asking for, but also to imply what they might need. Customers are not as well versed in the complexities of building software or meeting the needs of it. It is important to not only consider the wants of the clients but also the needs. Not only is it important because you want the customer to be satisfied with the final product, but it helps your longevity in this business. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
# I approached designing this project by not only listening to the customers wishes but also trying to look out for them. I feel that we must look at the bigger picture to interpret what they are doing or their wants into a system. I feel that I might have asked the customer more details than in the initial interview. I feel that I would like a better grasp on their needs.
